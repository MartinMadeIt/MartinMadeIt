### Hello everyone ! 👋

# Shortcut of my career path
💻 Started as Veterinarian with love to code and sport. In march 2021 decided to throw Vet job which didn't satisfy me. And decided to turn my hobby into everyday work 🐶 <br>
<br>
🐍 I started my coding adventure with Python and built some simple Apps (really simple) that was my tool for learning (e.g. flashcards)<br>
<br>
🏫 After obtaining DVM degree I decided to turn into IT more than just making simple apps. I went to postgraduate studies - Basic Frontend where I get some basic knowledge and skills in JS, HTML, CSS (and pre-proccessors), TS and basics of the most common frameworks. <br>
<br>
📜 Studies gave me some knowledge and skills but reveal how much effort and time I have to put in to get a dream Frontend Job. So I decided to take 100% of my time to learning. Contacted with my mentor that was big support in learning proccess and creating individual learning path. Also I decided to learn React, which is now my main framework and my daily biggest time absorber 😃<br>
<br>
⌚️ And here I am !

# Projects
On my page you can see only a few of my projects. Projects that are mainly focused on React. Other, pure JS projects are currently in old laptop that need repair and for now - this projects are not accesible for me. 🛠️
For now you can explore :
<br>
<br>[Restaurant App](https://github.com/MartinMadeIt/RestaurantApp) - my first React project. It evolved from simple exercise to something more project-like thing. Despite that theres a lot of libraries used - I decided to throw it in to respository.
<br>
<br>[Managing App](https://github.com/MartinMadeIt/ManagingStorage) - my second project that use Typescript and SASS. Firstly that was simply Redux training (mainly the withdraw and deposit feature). During the process I decided to add some features and make project from it. Some features are still under maintance. For now you can explore whole App except Magazine component. 
<br>
<br>
[Comunicator](https://github.com/MartinMadeIt/Comunicator) - my last project. It was fast project that arrised from just SQL training. Started from login auth in supabase but I decided to add table that contains informations like message, user infos, timestamp etc. Added some styles and here we are.
<br>
<br>
[🛠️Finance App](https://github.com/MartinMadeIt/finance) - This is some bigger project. It allows you to track your expenditures, create loans to track. Everything visualized in some charts. Currently project is still in development, and yesterday I started complete styles rebuilding due to weak RWD. More info in project repo.
<br>
<br>
[VUE site](https://github.com/MartinMadeIt/VUE-mini-project) - my first VUE project. It arised from learning VUE js. Main purpose was to make RWD landing page in VUE, but that was a little bit boring so I decided to add routing to /form and use Local Storage to handle datas.
