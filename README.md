### Hello everyone ! 👋

# About me and my career path
💻 I'm Marcin and I am React Frontend Developer but half year ago - I was Veterinarian 🐶 <br>
<br>
🐍 I'm interested in programming for a few years but in first I used to make some Python simple apps that was a tool to prepare for a college events like Farmacology test <br>
<br>
🎯 And that was the moment I realized that probably Vet is not my path. In spite of all I decided to get the DVM degree and try to like this job. <br>
<br>
Guess how it ends ! <br>
<br>
That was the moment I realized that if I want to be happy - I have to make a job that makes me happy, so I bet everything on one card . So in first 3 months of being Veterinarian (march 2021) I went to postgraduate Frontend studies where I learned JS, HTML, CSS, SCSS and some Angular. In this studies I also heared about ReactJS. <br>
When I got my diploma - I knew that if I want to have a dream Junior Frontend Developer Job - I have to invest 100% of my time to learn a lot before I'll send my first CV. So threw my Vet Job and I started cooperation with my mentor that show me roadpath to effective learning and developing React apps with best practices.
<br>
<br>
And I'm here ! 👋

# Projects
On my page you can see only a few of my projects. Projects that mainly focused on React. Other, pure JS projects are currently in old laptop that need repair and for now - this projects are not accesible for me.
For now you can explore :
<br>
<br>[Restaurant App](https://github.com/MartinMadeIt/RestaurantApp) - my first React project. It evolved from simple exercise to something more project-like thing. Despite that theres a lot of libraries used - I decided to throw it in to respository.
<br>
<br>[Managing App](https://github.com/MartinMadeIt/ManagingApp) - my second project that use Typescript and SASS. Firstly that was simply Redux training (mainly the withdraw and deposit feature). During the process I decided to add some features and make project from it. Some features are still under maintance. For now you can explore whole App except Magazine component. 
<br>
<br>
Communicator - my last project. It was fast project that arrised from just training SQL. Started from login auth in supabase but I decided to add table that contains informations like message, user infos, timestamp etc. Added some styles and here we are. I'm finalizing it and when I do the deploy - I will  provide link and code to repository.
